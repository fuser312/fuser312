### TicTacToe Game - [Google Play]() | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fuser312/tic_tac_toe_refactoring_starter)
Classical 2 player game with nice graphics and animations.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Built with: Flutter and Dart**
- Used encapsulation to keep the `game` logic separate from Flutter. So the same codebase can be used even for running the 
game in terminal
- Learnt about animations in Flutter and created custom animation curve.
